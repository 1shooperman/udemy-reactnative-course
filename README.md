# notes:
if modals ever get super slow for you, you might have slow animations turned on in the simulator. Made deving a living hell today, hopefully this saves someone the trouble. On iOS sim this gets toggled with `CMD + T` 

state v. props:  We use state for internal component state, we use props to communicate between parent and child

you can only use state with class based components

`yarn start --reset-cache`

`react-native link`
